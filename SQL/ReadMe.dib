## Setup

To follow along with running the code samples in this notebook, you will need to edit and then run the [A0X-School.sql](./A0X-School.sql) script. In that script, perform a search-and-replace (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd>) where you will replace the `A0X` in the name `A0X-School` with your actual section number.

Once you have created the database from the `A0X-School` script, run the following block to install the required packages for this notebook.

#!csharp

#r "nuget:Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.SqlServer,*-*"
